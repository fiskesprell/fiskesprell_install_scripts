This is the script I use after running a fresh install of Linux Mint
The purpose is to set up my most-used programs, support for media keys & touchpad gestures, and adding my keybindings.

Please read through the script before running it on your own device.
I would advise commenting out the "scaling" section if you do not have the same screen resolution as me
